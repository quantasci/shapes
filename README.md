# shapes
Shapes is a lightweight, node-based renderer for dynamic and natural systems. The goal of shapes is to enable rapid experimentation with dynamic, 
coupled systems, especially those in which the scene graph can change each frame. Shapes makes use of a graph model to evaluate  dynamic _behaviors_ 
that update geometric instances call _shapes_. Shapes incorporates both an OpenGL core rasterizer and OptiX pure raytracing pipelines which can be
switched at run-time. Shapes allows for composition and coupling of complex models through node-graphs.
